# Quantitative_Research_June_2024

This project contains my work on tasks that simulate what a quantitative researcher might do. I anaylized two papers that presented different ways of estimate trade costs and slippage. I implemented their estimation models in python. Inside of the Stock_Features repo, I use a prebuilt ML model and add onto it my own features to help train the model that I could build using the stock dataset in the same folder.
