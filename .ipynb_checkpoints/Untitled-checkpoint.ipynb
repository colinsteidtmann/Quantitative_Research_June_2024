    "# Measuring and Modeling Execution Cost and Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research, I learned that transaction cost analysis can be broken into two main parts: measurement and estimation. Costs are *measured* after trading to determine the portfolio slippage due to trading and to evaluate the performance of traders and brokers. Costs are *estimated* before trading and used to devise an appropriate implementation scheme. My focus here is on the measurement side.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \"Measuring and Modeling Execution Cost and Risk\" (Engle, Ferstenberg, Russell, 2006), they introduce a model that explicitly recognizes the importance of the timing of execution in assessing transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Time induces a risk/cost tradeoff. The price of immediacy results in higher costs for quickly executed orders while more gradual trading results in higher risk since the value of the asset can vary more over longer periods of time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's important to recognize the cost/risk tradeoff this paper introduces. For example, a buy order could be filled by submitting a market order and paying a price near the ask. Alternatively, the order could be submitted as a limit order and either execute at a better price, or not execute at all. Similarly, a single order called a *parent order* is often broken up into a sequence of smaller ones spread out over time. Parent orders executed over a short period of time will have a high expected cost associated with immediate execution, but the risk will be low since the price is (nearly) known immediately. Orders executed over a long period of time may have a smaller price impact and therefore smaller expected cost but may be riskier since the asset price can vary more over longer periods of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper dives into estimating the cost/risk tradeoff. Their dataset consisted of 233,913 orders executed by Morgan Stanley in 2004, including information about when the order was submitted and the times, prices, and quantities traded in filling the order. They model both the expected cost and the risk as a function of a series of conditioning variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The first term captures the local cost, i.e., the difference between the transaction price and the market price, *$p_t$*. The second term captures the cost due to price impact. Typically, the price will increase as a large order is executed (supply and demand), so each additional price change, $(\\Delta p_t)$, affects and is applied to the remaining shares transacted, $(x_T - x_{t-1})$.\n",
